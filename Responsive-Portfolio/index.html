                    <img src="assets/images/Abhinav.jpg" class="homepage" alt="Abhinav" width="40%" height="40%"> I am a Quality Engineer or QA or Test Engineer by profession. I have been working in IT since last 8
                    years. I work for Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd and my project is for Travelers Insurance, St Paul. I
                    moved to Minnesota 4 years ago for my work from India and I have been here since then. I grew up and
                    studied in north-west India. My job involves testing the code written by developers in my team, writing
                    automated test cases for UI and services and working with them to find and fix issues. Since I am in
                    an agile team, I also work as a part time developer and write code in Java. I like coding and I am looking
                    for opportunities in my work to do more of it.
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            I am also a musician and I play various percussion instruments like Tabla, Drums, Cajon, Congas, Darbuka, etc. Basically
                            any surface that can produce sound. I have been learning and playing since last 15 years. I do
                            play in some concerts here and there and have been collaborating with various bands/musicians.
                            I have also recorded some tracks for CDs with them.

                            Apart from these my other passions include Photography, Sketching and Painting. I like to click wildlife and nature pictures.
                            I started skecthing even before I could write and love to skecth big cats. I can draw a tiger
                            in seconds. I am also a big sports fan namely soccer, tennis and cricket. I am a huge fan of
                            the Football Club Barcelona and Lionel Messi. I idolize the world renowned percussionist Zakir
                            Hussain.
